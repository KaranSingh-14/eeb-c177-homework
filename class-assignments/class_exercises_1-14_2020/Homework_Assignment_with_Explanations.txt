Homework Assignment With Explanation

Code: cd Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/class_exercises_1-14-2020/data-shell

Leads to data-shell directory

Code: pwd

Prints the working directoty and shows me that I am in the data-shell directory

Code: ls -F

This is list command that shows what the data-shell directory contains

Code: mkdir thesis

Makes a directory called thesis in data-shell directory

Code: ls -F

This is list command that shows what the data-shell directory contains

Code: ls -F thesis

A way to ensure that you are in the correct directory and it is empty

Code: cd thesis

cd (change directory) changes directory to thesis

Code: nano draft.txt

This uses a program called nano to create a text file and the name gets assigned acording to what one puts after "nano" in their code

Code: ctrl + o, enter, ctrl + x

This is used to save and then exit out of the text file.

Code: ls

This shows that the draft file appears in the thesis folder.

Code: touch my_file.txt

This made a new file named my_file.txt

Code: ls -l

This command shows the information of the files. The my_file.txt was 0 bytes because it had no content.

Code: ~/Developer/repos/eeb-c177-homework/class-assignments/class_exercises_1-14-2020/data-shell

This took me back to the data-shell folder.

Code: mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt

This renamed the draft.txt to quotes.txt. The folder it is in remained the same.

Code: ls thesis

This confirms the previous changes.

Code: mv thesis/quotes.txt . 

This moves the file quotes.txt from the thesis folder to the folder I was working in.

Code: ls thesis

No file named quotes.txt is in the thesis folder.

Code: ls quotes.txt

The file shows up in the current working directory.

Code: cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

This copies the quotes file to the thesis folder and renames it as quotations.txt

Code: ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt

This shows that the quotes.txt file is still in the current directory and a copy is in the thesis folder.

Code: cp -r thesis thesis_backup

This created a backup folder called thesis_backup. 

Code: ls thesis thesis_backup

Both the thesis folder and thesis_backup show up in the working directory.

Code: rm quote.txt

Removed quotes.txt

Code: ls quotes.txt

No file such as quotes.txt is in the working directory.

Code: rm -r thesis

Removed thesis folder

Code: cd data

Changed directory to data.

Code: mkdir backup

Made backup folder

Code: cp amino-acid.txt animals.txt backup/

This copied the files (amino-acid.txt animals.txt) to the backup folder. 


Exercises: 


1. Touch command creates a new file called my_file.txt 
2. The command ls -l is used to inspect lines and my_file.txt is 0 bytes.
3. This can be done for programs that are not able to create output files themselves (for example nano) and require empty files that have already been generated. THe touch command does not require this type of procedure.

4. The mistake is that Sucrose and Maltose need to be in the raw folder.

5. mv statstics.txt statistics.txt is the command I would use to rename file


6. THe output of the closing ls command is that recombine folder will show up since it is the only directory in the data


7. It will remove the regular file and this output will show up, $ rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'? y
 


8. If given one file name that is followed by a directory name, then cp will copy the file to the named directory (if the destination directory must be the last argument.) If you have three file names, cp showsan error because it does not receive a directory name as the last argument. The error code would look like this: cp: target ‘morse.txt’ is not a directory.



9. ls *t??ne.pdb is the ls command that will yeild the outcome of ethane.pdb methane.pdb



10. These are the commands that should be typed out: 
$ cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
$ cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
$ cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/



11. Jamie needs to move her files fructose.dat and sucrose.dat to the analyzed directory. 



12. Commands 1 and 2 will work to achieve this objective:

Command 1 
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw

Command 2
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
