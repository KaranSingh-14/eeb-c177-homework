In order to highlight the first word in every sentence. 
You have to use a ^ which gets the begining the of a line and then the \w to capture word characters and the * means from 0 onwards and | is the pipe command that is used to separate commands for the computer to follow
 its important to create a word boundary so you dont continues to highlight everything after the starting word string command and this is done via the \b which creates a boundary and makes sure to exclude periods, exclamation points and question marks. 
The ? allows you to match 0 or 1 of the previous characters and > makes it the end of the word (its the look behind feature) which in this cases means to not include ., ?, or ! in the string of the new word at the start of a new sentence.
